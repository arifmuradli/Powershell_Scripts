## This script uses LastLogonTimestamp instead of LastLogon or LastLogonDate
###LastLogonTimestamp: This is typically the most accurate for identifying inactive computers. It's replicated across domain controllers, so it provides a consistent value across the domain, but it's not updated in real-timeâ€”it can be up to 14 days behind.
####LastLogon: This is the most precise as it's updated every time a user logs in, but it's only stored on the domain controller that handled the login, so it requires querying all domain controllers to get an accurate picture.
#####LastLogonDate: This is not a built-in attribute in AD but is often used in scripts as a human-readable format of LastLogonTimestamp. It's convenient for reporting but doesn't offer additional accuracy beyond LastLogonTimestamp.
